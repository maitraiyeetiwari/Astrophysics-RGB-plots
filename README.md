# Astrophysics-RGB-plots
In this project, I made and plotted an rgb fits file from CII, 8micron and 870micron emission images.
# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: aplpy, matplotlib
# Model Building
I have used fits files of CII, 8micron and 870 micron images (in same resolution) to make an rgb fits file using make-rgb.py script. Then I plot this image displaying interesting regions (white boxes) and stars (pink) in RCW49, which is bright star-forming region in our Galaxy.
